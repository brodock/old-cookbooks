This is My Cookbooks focused on configuring and deploying
applications on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS

For Ruby on Rails applications I've decided to use RVM to be able to easily
update Ruby versions when needed and also to help isolate using gemsets,
older applications that doesn't use Bundler yet.

For web servers, nginx is my prefered choice as it's faster then any other, 
lightweight and powerfull enought for all my needs.

To deploy and manage Ruby on Rails application I decided to stay with Passenger
until I find that anything Unicorn or similars offers are a must for a project.
